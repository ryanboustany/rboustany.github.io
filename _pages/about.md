I am a second-year PhD candidate jointly affiliated with TSE, ANITI, and Thales LAS France. My advisors are Jérôme Bolte and Edouard Pauwels from TSE, along with Béatrice Pesquet-Popescu from Thales. My research focuses on analyzing the sensitivity and robustness of neural networks through conservative calculus, with a specific interest in nonsmooth automatic differentiation.
