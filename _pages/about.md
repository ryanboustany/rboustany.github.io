I am a second-year PhD candidate jointly affiliated with [TSE](https://www.tse-fr.eu/fr), [ANITI](https://aniti.univ-toulouse.fr), and Thales LAS France. 

My advisors are [Jérôme Bolte](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=Re1SrTkAAAAJ) and [Edouard Pauwels](https://www.irit.fr/~Edouard.Pauwels/) from TSE, along with [Béatrice Pesquet-Popescu](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?hl=fr&user=afgNSP8AAAAJ) from Thales. 

My research focuses on the sensitivity and robustness of neural networks through conservative calculus, with a specific interest in nonsmooth automatic differentiation.
