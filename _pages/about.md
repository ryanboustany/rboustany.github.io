I am a third-year PhD candidate jointly affiliated with [TSE](https://www.tse-fr.eu/fr), [ANITI](https://aniti.univ-toulouse.fr), and Thales LAS France. 

I am supervized by [Jérôme Bolte](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=Re1SrTkAAAAJ) and [Edouard Pauwels](https://www.irit.fr/~Edouard.Pauwels/) from TSE, alongside with [Béatrice Pesquet-Popescu](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?hl=fr&user=afgNSP8AAAAJ) from Thales. 

My research focuses on stochastic optimization algorithms for machine learning, with a broader interest in computational and statistical challenges. I also explore the sensitivity and robustness of neural networks, particularly through nonconvex optimization, nonsmooth automatic differentiation, first-order methods, and their applications in machine learning.
